Welcome to Binc IMAP! This is the documentation for v@VERSION@.

Here is a quick guide on how to setup IMAP on your system.

Note that this is not the full documentation for Binc IMAP. You will
find more about the server by viewing the man pages and reading
through the bundled documentation under /opt/bincimap/doc.

You can also check out the project home page's FAQ and the Life With
Binc IMAP community documentation site:

For instructions on compiling from the tarball, please scroll down.

If you do not plan to modify the original source code, it will suffice
to grab one of the precompiled binary RPM packages from:

http://www.bincimap.org/dl/RPMS

NOTE: These are RedHat/SuSe packages. There are packages available for
Mandrake, Debian and FreeBSD among other distributions. Search for
"Binc IMAP" or "bincimap" on the respective distributions' web sites
to learn more.

If you can't find a precompiled binary that matches your system, you
can grab a source RPM from here:

http://www.bincimap.org/dl/SRPMS

To create RPM packages for your system, you can run the following
command as root:

rpmbuild --rebuild bincimap-a.b.c-d.src.rpm

At the end of the input, you will see where your binary package has
been generated. If the rebuild fails, the package is easy to
build from the tarball.

=========================================================================

Here's how to set up the service when building from the tarball.  Note
that if you experience any problems in this section, do not hesitate
to post your problems to the Binc IMAP mailing list.

----------------------
1) Compile the service
----------------------

./configure
make
make install    # Note: Mac OS X users need to use "sudo make install"

        Add --enable-static to ./configure to build a static binary
        (a binary that does not depend on the shared libraries on
        the machine it's built on).

        If you want to place the binaries and configuration files in
        a different place from what's default, use the --prefix and
        --sysconfdir arguments to configure.

        To set the location of the log directories (with multilog),
        set --localstatedir.

        If you want smaller binaries, run "make install-strip" instead
        of "make install".

        To create a self signed SSL certificate, run "make testcert". Read
        more on SSL certificates in README.SSL.

--------------------------------
2) Apply necessary configuration
--------------------------------

        Edit the destination bincimap.conf file, which by default is
        installed under /etc/opt/bincimap. Check each
        individual setting.

         * Note the location of your server's SSL PEM-encoded
           certificate. If you do not have one, you can run "make testcert"
           to create a test certificate. 
         * Note the default path to users' mail depot, relative to the
           users' home directories. If the depot directory is ~/Maildir,
           set path = "Maildir". If the depot is the current directory,
           set path = ".". Remember that if you're using
           IMAPdir, the depot needs to have a mailbox called INBOX.
         * Use the man pages bundled with the distribution, under
           the man/ directory.

        You can read more about this in the bundled FAQ under the
        doc/ directory.

        If using daemontools' supervise, tcpserver and multilog,
        create the multilog directores.

mkdir -p /var/opt/log/bincimap{,-ssl}
chown nobody.nobody /var/opt/log/bincimap{,-ssl}

        xinetd users will be more familiar with using syslog.

----------------------------
3) Install the service files
----------------------------

        With xinetd:

        Edit /etc/opt/bincimap/xinetd/imap and
        /etc/opt/bincimap/xinetd/imaps and check that the locations
        of configuration files and binaries are correct.

        Note the location of your checkpassword authenticator in
        particular, and use the man pages to find what options you need
        to pass.

        You may also want to symlink them to /etc/xinetd.d instead
        of copying the files.

ln -s /etc/opt/bincimap/xinetd/imap /etc/xinetd.d/imap
ln -s /etc/opt/bincimap/xinetd/imaps /etc/xinetd.d/imaps
service xinetd restart

        With daemontools' supervise:

        Edit /etc/opt/bincimap/service/imap/run,
        /etc/opt/bincimap/service/imap/log/run,
        /etc/opt/bincimap/service/imaps/run and
        /etc/opt/bincimap/service/imaps/log/run and
        check that the locations are correct.
        Note the location of your authenticator in particular.

        Then copy or symlink the service files in place.

ln -s /etc/opt/bincimap/service/imap /service/imap
ln -s /etc/opt/bincimap/service/imaps /service/imaps

        There are 'down' files in both service directories,
        so you will have to run 'svc -u' on both services (and
        log files) to get them running.

----------------------------
4) Securing your service
----------------------------

        - It's a good thing to not allow users to pass their passwords
          over a plain text connection. Require that your users enable
          SSL by setting this option in your Authentication section
          in bincimap.conf:

            allow plain auth in non ssl = "no"

        - Binc IMAP allows users to retry a login if the password they
          submit is wrong. To make it harder for malicious users to
          brute force passwords, Binc IMAP allows you to make it sleep
          for a certain number of seconds after a failed password. You
          can set this to 0, for no penalty, but this is a recommended
          value:

            auth penalty = 4

        - The bincimap-up stub channels input to and output from the
          main IMAP server. It does this in what we call a "chroot
          jail". Make sure you set the path to an empty directory on
          your server, preferable one in which a certain unprivileged
          user has no rights:

            Security {
                jail path = "/opt/bincimap/bin",
                jail user = "nobody",
                jail group = "nobody"
            }

Happy IMAPing! With these settings your copy of Binc IMAP should be
operational.  For more information, please check out the man pages and
FAQ.
                                                   Andy :-)
